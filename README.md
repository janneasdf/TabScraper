# TabScraper
This is a Python script for easily downloading Guitar Pro tabs (.gpx) from the ultimate-guitar.com collection. The script asks the user for an artist name, and then downloads the best rated version of all the guitar tabs found from the artist. 

This script makes it easy to download many interesting Guitar Pro tabs at once, without having to manually browse the website for each different tab and try to find the best version.

The script is a work in progress, although it already does what it promises. Future changes probably include making it a lot faster by changing the way the HTML pages are parsed. Also, a simple to use GUI with some options for search criteria and such might be implemented later.
